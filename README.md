## Overview

artemis is an application that allows users to store and query client data.

Users can quickly query the data entering the Owner's Last Name and the Pet's Name.

If no matches are found, the application will return a message to the user saying that the client they are trying to find does not exist in the database.

Users also can add new clients to the database or add new pets to existing owners found in the database.
